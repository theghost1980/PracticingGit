## About this Repository
This is intended to practice while I get used to git + github.
I will be playing around with this repository in order to upload: some tips that I will be learning about Javascript, Git, Github and Microverse.

### This README file
It was created using the command line on a Macbook, just for fun and also to improve my git skills.
